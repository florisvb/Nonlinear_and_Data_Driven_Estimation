        "The primary purpose of ***pybounds*** is to evaluate the observability of state variables describing a system. This is done by numerically simulating the system with perturbations to the initial state variables. This means that the system does not have to be in closed-form, e.g. $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = f(\\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t))$ to analyze it. We provide a basic `Simulator` class that works well for numerically simulating simple closed-form ODE's. However, it is often appropriate to build your own custom simulator. The main reason to build a custom simulator is if your system is not a simple ODE that can be simulated in Python and requires outside software/packages to simulate. Systems involving things like computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, physics engines, neural networks, etc. are all fair game as long as the simulation can be called from Python. This guide will illustrate how to get started building a custom simulator.\n",
