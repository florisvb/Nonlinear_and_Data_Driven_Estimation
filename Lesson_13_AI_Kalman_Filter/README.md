# Overview

This lesson covers the Augmented Information Kalman Filter framework. We augment the measurement vector with an ANN estimate of 1 or more states, and use insight from the observability analysis to determine how to augment the measurement covariance matrix $R$ so that these ANN estimates are only used by the (U)KF when they are likely to be accurate (due to high observability for the given state).
